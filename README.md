# DDMre (Dungeon Dice Monsters remake)

![Demo](gallert/demo1_short.gif)

# What is this?
**DDMre** is a remake of the GBA game [Yu-Gi-Oh! Dungeon Dice Monsters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu-Gi-Oh!_Dungeon_Dice_Monsters) in the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/) for mobile devices. The idea is to recreate the core game mechanics from the original, taking only a few liberties, while adding some modern features like a decent AI, and possibly online multiplayer. 

*It is in very early stages*  and is not playable yet.

# Why?
I've always been a huge fan of Dungeon Dice Monsters game mechanics, but the few implementations that have been made are very lackluster. In particular, the GBA game (the only official video game version) is really held back by the terrible AI programming of the opponents: stupid dimension positions, nonsensical monster movements, failed attempts to defend the monster lord, etc. Konami has essentially abandoned this game, so I decided to make my own version...
